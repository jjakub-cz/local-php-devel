# local-php-devel

Why? Because I'm lazy! :-)

And you should be too. Anything that will help you maintain your workflow and keeps your mind sane is HUGE help.

So what this is? Quick start for your local project, never mind if you are working on Windows in WSL or on Linux.
Run this command from home directory of this project:
```
./run.sh -n <name-for-container> -v <path-to-your-web-app>
```
and it will start up docker with your application on port 3003.

Enjoy! Feel free to fork, edit and whatever.
